I study motor skill acquisition. Or how to learn to move with a level of expertise, like playing my favorite sport :basketball:. 

The most beautiful thing to me is the reciprocal relationship between the brain and the body: the brain "controls" the body, and movements of the body also alter the brain. The real reason for brain is to control <b>movement/motor behavior</b>. This [Ted Talk](https://youtu.be/7s0CpRfyYp8) by Daniel Wolpert and this [article](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(16)31040-6.pdf) by John Krakauer *et al.* articulate this view very eloquently.


Our ability to learn motor skills is related to visuospatial ability, the cognitive ability to perceive the spatial relations :triangular_ruler: to objects we interact with through vision :eye:. My overall research question is: _"can changes in visuospatial ability affect motor skill acquisition?"_ 

I use neuromodulation to tackle this question. Neuromodulation, by its name, is to modulate neural activity purposefully. _Can we enhance visuospatial function through neuromodulation, and thereby enhance motor skill learning?_ Answering these questions can reveal an opportunity to improve motor learning, which ultimately leads to better performance. 

Below are my recent projects for this research. I am working on developing the contents, but all the titles are out there so that you can get a :eyes: of what I am doing.
