### About me

Welcome to my corner of the digital arena, or as I call it, Boki's Bowl! 
  
I am Boki Buckets, a basketball enthusiast (obviously) and seasoned data scientist on a mission to revolutionize Chinese basketball and empower female professionals in the industry.

I specialize in using data analytics to inform better strategy and execution in both game and practice settings for players, coaches and staff. With a M.S in Kinesiology and a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering, I thrive on tackling hard questions related to game preparation, practice design, player evaluation and effective teaching and learning strategies. My experience includes working in top leagues like the WNBA and Overtime Elite alongside world-class athletes.

Beyond basketball, I'm a creative at heart, blending my interests for writing, design and goofing around. 

In Boki's bowl, I serve up the food for thought I've gathered along the way, seasoned with scientific methods and a people-first mindset. Perhaps you'll find a serving or two that satisfies your appetite. 

Cheers (pun intended), 

Boki Buckets
